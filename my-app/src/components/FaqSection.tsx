      question: "What is EMI?",
      answer:
        "EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both the principal and interest on a loan, so that over a specified number of years, the loan is fully paid off along with interest.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is EMI calculated?",
      answer:
        "EMI is calculated using the formula: EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n/((1 + r)^n - 1), where P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate per month, and n is the total number of months.",
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect EMI?",
      answer:
        "Your EMI is affected by three main factors: the principal loan amount, the interest rate, and the loan tenure (duration). A higher loan amount or interest rate will increase your EMI, while a longer loan tenure will decrease your monthly EMI but increase the total interest paid.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make prepayments to reduce EMI?",
      answer:
        "Yes, making prepayments can help reduce your future EMIs or loan tenure. However, some loans may have prepayment penalties, so it's important to check your loan terms before making additional payments.",
    },
